# ☕ FreshlyGround Cafe – AWS re/Start Portfolio Project

This project demonstrates how a small café can begin migrating to **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** by designing a cloud architecture and hosting a **static website using Amazon S3**.

This project is beginner-friendly and focuses on understanding core AWS services and how they work together.

## 📌 Project Aim

The aim of this project is to:
- Design a **high-level AWS cloud architecture** for a café that is transitioning from on-premises systems
- Host a **static café website** using Amazon S3
- Understand how AWS services support scalability, availability, and online presence

## 🏗️ AWS Architecture Design

A high-level AWS architecture was designed to show how FreshlyGround Cafe could migrate its systems to AWS.

The architecture includes:
- Regional services such as **Amazon S3, AWS Lambda, and Amazon DynamoDB**
- Availability Zone–based services such as **Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS, and Amazon RDS (Multi-AZ)**
- Security and migration services to support future growth

## ☁️ AWS Services Used

- **Amazon S3** – Static website hosting
- **Amazon EC2** – Compute services
- **AWS Lambda** – Serverless event processing
- **Amazon RDS (Multi-AZ)** – Relational database
- **Amazon DynamoDB** – NoSQL database
- **Amazon EBS** – Persistent storage for EC2
- **AWS IAM** – Access control and permissions
- **Amazon Cognito** – User authentication

As part of the project, a static website was created and hosted using **Amazon S3 Static Website Hosting**.

The website includes:
- Café name
- Business description
- Contact information
- A menu with at least five items
