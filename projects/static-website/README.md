# ☕ FreshlyGround Cafe – AWS re/Start Portfolio Project

This project demonstrates how a small café can begin migrating to **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** by designing a cloud architecture and hosting a **static website using Amazon S3**.

This project is beginner-friendly and focuses on understanding core AWS services and how they work together.

## 📌 Project Aim

The aim of this project is to:
- Design a **high-level AWS cloud architecture** for a café that is transitioning from on-premises systems
- Host a **static café website** using Amazon S3
- Understand how AWS services support scalability, availability, and online presence

## 🏗️ AWS Architecture Design

A high-level AWS architecture was designed to show how FreshlyGround Cafe could migrate its systems to AWS.

The architecture includes:
- Regional services such as **Amazon S3, AWS Lambda, and Amazon DynamoDB**
- Availability Zone–based services such as **Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS, and Amazon RDS (Multi-AZ)**
- Security and migration services to support future growth
