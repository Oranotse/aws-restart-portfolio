# 📂 SimuLearn: File Systems in the Cloud

## 🧾 Overview
In this lab, I worked with Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) to understand how shared file storage works in AWS. I configured an EFS file system, ensured the correct mount target was available in the appropriate Availability Zone, and mounted it to an EC2 instance to test file access.

## 📘 What I Learned
- How Amazon EFS provides shared, scalable file storage within a VPC
- The importance of mount targets in specific Availability Zones
- How Security Groups control NFS traffic (TCP port 2049)
- How to mount EFS to an EC2 instance and verify file persistence
