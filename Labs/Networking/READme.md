# 🌐 Connecting VPCs – AWS SimuLearn

## 🧾 Overview
In this assignment, I configured VPC peering to connect three separate Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) within AWS ☁️: a Marketing VPC, a Finance VPC, and a Developer VPC. 

The objective was to allow EC2 instances in the Marketing and Developer VPCs to securely communicate with a Finance server located in a different VPC. To achieve this, I created VPC peering connections and updated the route tables in each VPC to ensure traffic was correctly routed between their respective CIDR blocks.

## 📘 What I Learned
- How VPC peering enables private communication between separate VPCs 🔗  
- Why route tables must be updated to allow traffic flow between peered VPCs 🛣️
